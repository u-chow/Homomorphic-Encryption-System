# Homomorphic Encryption System

This project demonstrates how to securely transmit and process sensitive data (including text, numbers, or mixed input) between two parties (Company A and Company B) using the Paillier Homomorphic Encryption scheme.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `public_key.txt`: Public key generated by Company B and shared with Company A.
- `private_key.txt`: Private key securely stored by Company B.
- `encrypted_data.txt`: Encrypted data generated by Company A and sent to Company B.

## 🔑 Workflow

### 1. Key Generation (Company B)
- Company B generates a public-private key pair.
- The public key (`public_key.txt`) is shared with Company A.
- The private key (`private_key.txt`) is stored securely by Company B.

**Run:**
```bash
python key_generation.py
```

### 2. Data Encryption (Company A)
- Company A loads the public key from Company B.
- Company A inputs sensitive data (supports text, numbers, or mixed data).
- The data is encrypted and saved as `encrypted_data.txt`.
- The encrypted file is sent to Company B.

**Run:**
```bash
python data_encryption.py
```

### 3. Data Decryption (Company B)
- Company B loads the encrypted data and its private key.
- Company B decrypts the data, automatically handling text and numeric data.

**Run:**
```bash
python data_decryption.py
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- **Public Key Sharing:** Use secure channels (TLS/SSL) for public key transmission.
- **Private Key Storage:** Keep the private key secure in access-controlled environments.
- **Encrypted Data Transmission:** Use secure file transfer methods for encrypted data.

## 📦 Requirements

- `phe` library for Paillier encryption

**Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install phe
```
